.. Inferring the stellar parameters of the Sun 

=================================
Example: SEGUE calibration sample 
=================================

In this example we will use the *"calibration sample"* observed by SEGUE, which was used to calibrate their
stellar parameter pipeline such that it gives sensible results. We will use an existing published grid of
model spectra and infer the parameters of these stars, and demonstrate that we can obtain increased precision
and accuracy **without** the need for any ad-hoc calibration or fitting.
